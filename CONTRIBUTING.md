## Committing

`xpc-connect` is protected by commitizen which will block all commits unless they are formatted to `cz-conventional-changelog` standards. You can read more about commitizen [here](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).

When ready to commit stage your commits then run `npm run commit` to walk through a curated commit workflow.

example usage:

```bash
git add -A
npm run commit
git push
```
