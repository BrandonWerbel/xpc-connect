## Committing

`xpc-connect` is protected by commitizen which will block all commits unless they are formatted to `cz-conventional-changelog` standards. You can read more about commitizen [here](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).

When ready to commit stage your commits then run `git commit -m "your commit message"` to walk through a curated commit workflow.

example usage:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push
```
